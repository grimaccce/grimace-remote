# Grimace Remote: Monthly Maintenance Checklist

To maintain your **#1 Ranking** and keep clients coming in, follow this simple routine once a month.

## 📅 The "Monday Morning" Routine (Weekly)
- [ ] **Check GMB Ranking**: Search for "Tech Support Bairnsdale" in Incognito. Are you still Top 3?
- [ ] **Reply to Reviews**: Use the **[Review Reply Templates](file:///Users/ipwnbookair/Downloads/grimace-remote%20(10)/REVIEW-REPLY-TEMPLATES.md)** to answer any new feedback.
- [ ] **Post to GMB**: Use the **[GMB Post Calendar](file:///Users/ipwnbookair/Downloads/grimace-remote%20(10)/GMB-POST-CALENDAR.md)** and Ad Generator to post one "Local Tip."

## 🛠️ The Business Health Check (Monthly)
- [ ] **Run Health Check**: Run `./grimace.sh` and select **Option 7** to ensure all project files are healthy.
- [ ] **Review Pricing**: Check if your competitors have lowered prices. If needed, update **business-info.json** and run the Sync (Option 1).
- [ ] **Analyze Insights**: Check **Google Business Insights** (Option 8 in grimace.sh) to see how many people called you this month.

## 📈 Long-Term Growth Goals
- [ ] **Milestone Check**: Are you close to 50 reviews? 100? Use the **Ad Generator** (Milestone Theme) to celebrate your success.
- [ ] **Town Expansion**: Are you getting calls from **Sale** or **Paynesville**? Double down on those towns in your next GMB posts.
