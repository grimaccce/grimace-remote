## 3. The "Direct Text" Advantage
On your website, you now have `sms:` links. 
- When a user on an iPhone or Android taps "Text an Expert," it opens their default messaging app with your number ready to go.
- **Goal**: Respond within 5-10 minutes. Speed is the #1 factor in closing leads from mobile devices.
